  **Introduction**
  
Objective of the Project 

The goal of this project is to analyze Oreo’s sales data for 2023 to understand key performance 
trends across customers, products, and regions. 

Problem Being Addressed 

Sales data can often be fragmented, making it difficult for management to see where the 
strongest and weakest areas lie. This analysis organizes and visualizes the data to reveal the most 
profitable regions, products, and customers that drive Oreo’s success. 

Key Datasets and Methodologies 

The dataset includes Oreo’s 2023 sales transactions categorized by region, city, product type, and 
sales representatives. 

All analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, utilizing: 

• PivotTables for data aggregation 

• COUNTIFS and SUMIFS for conditional analysis 

• Charts and maps for visual representation of sales distribution 

• Interactive dashboard elements for deeper insight 

  **Story of Data** 

The dataset captures Oreo’s sales performance across U.S. regions and cities in 2023, 

highlighting top customers, leading products, and the sales trend over months. 

Stakeholders of the Project 

• Sales managers monitoring performance

market behavior. 

Data Splitting and Preprocessing 

Data Cleaning

Data Splitting 

The analysis was split across: 

1. Product categories 

2. Customers 

3. Salespersons 

4. Regional performance 

Industry Context 

This study falls under FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) analytics, where data-driven 
insights guide sales strategy, regional expansion, and marketing focus. 

  **Pre-Analysis Insights** 

• The North region recorded the highest revenue at $141,680, followed by the East at 
$108,276. 

• Beverages were the top-selling product, generating $110,577 in revenue. 

• Nancy Freehafer was the top-performing salesperson, contributing 39.3% of total sales.

northern and eastern United States. 

  **In-Analysis Observations** 

• The sales trend fluctuated through the year, with strong peaks in June, October, and 
December, indicating seasonal demand cycles. 

• Beverages dominated product sales, followed by Sauces ($69,000) and Jams & Preserves 
($51,541), showing a balanced product mix. 

• Among customers, Company D, H, and BB collectively contributed the majority of total 
sales revenue. 

• Regional performance analysis revealed a strong North-South disparity, with the South 
and West lagging behind. 

• Sales by City map visualization highlighted clusters of high sales density in northeastern 
states. 

• The top three salespersons contributed over 75% of all revenue, showing concentrated 
sales performance. 

• Despite monthly fluctuations, total annual revenue showed steady upward momentum 
from mid-year onward. 

• Nancy Freehafer’s performance led all others, suggesting strong client management or 
regional dominance. 

• The West region showed lower performance, indicating possible market underpenetration 
or limited distribution coverage. 

Methods Used in Excel 

• PivotTables for regional and product segmentation 

• COUNTIFS for tracking sales frequency 

• AVERAGEIFS for city-level revenue comparison 

• Charts, slicers, and conditional formatting for visualization clarity 

  **Post-Analysis Recommendations** 

• Regional Focus: Strengthen marketing and distribution efforts in the South and West to 
balance national sales performance. 

• Customer Relations: Maintain partnerships with Company D and Company H, while 
exploring acquisition of mid-tier clients to diversify revenue. 

• Product Strategy: Expand the Beverages and Sauces categories, as they show consistent 
performance across all regions. 

• Salesperson Development: Study Nancy Freehafer’s sales approach for potential 
replication in lower-performing territories. 

• Seasonal Campaigns: Leverage sales peaks in June and December with promotional 
campaigns. 

• Data Continuity: Continue collecting and analyzing multi-year data to better understand 
long-term growth trends. 

• City-Level Penetration: Enhance outreach in mid-performing cities to close the gap 
between top and bottom markets. 

Comparison with Initial Insights 

Initial assumptions about Beverages and Northern region dominance were validated, though the 
sharp variation between months suggests stronger planning is needed for off-peak periods. 

  **Data Visualizations & Charts** 

The analysis featured several visuals: 

• Pie Charts: Top Customers, Products, and Salespersons. 

• Line Chart: Monthly Sales Trend (January–December). 

• Radar Chart: Regional Performance Comparison. 

• Map Visualization: City-wise sales distribution. 

These visuals provided an integrated dashboard view summarizing Oreo’s 2023 performance. 

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how Excel can effectively transform sales data into business 
intelligence for fast-moving consumer goods like Oreo. 
The analysis highlights strong performance in northern regions, clear product leaders, and 
valuable insights into customer and salesperson dynamics. 
Overall, Excel’s visualization and analytical capabilities allowed for a comprehensive 
understanding of Oreo’s 2023 sales structure proving that even traditional tools can power 
modern data-driven decision-making.
